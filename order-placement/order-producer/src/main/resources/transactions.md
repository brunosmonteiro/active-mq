## Transactions in the Producer
Transactions enable message processing with ACID guarantees. They ensure that a series of operations are completed 
successfully or none at all. Here's how transactions work for producers in the context of ActiveMQ:

1. **Begin Transaction**: When you create a session with the first parameter as true, you are working in a transactional 
context. Any messages sent within the session are part of a single transaction.
2. **Commit Transaction**: If all operations (like sending messages) are successful, you can commit the transaction using 
session.commit(). This confirms that all the messages sent within the transaction are to be delivered to the broker.
3. **Rollback Transaction**: If something goes wrong, you can call session.rollback(), which will revert all the 
operations performed during that transaction. Messages sent will not be sent to the broker.

Let's suppose we send three different messages to a broker. In a non-transactional mode, each message would be sent to 
the broker as soon as the send method is called; There would be no grouping of the three send operations into a single 
transaction, so there would be no atomicity across them.

If we are in a transactional context, the three send calls would be grouped into a single transaction, and their 
execution would be handled atomically. As you call `producer.send(message)` for each of the three messages, they would be 
staged together but not immediately sent to the destination. You would then call `session.commit()` to commit the 
transaction. At this point, all three messages would be sent to the broker atomically. They would become visible to 
consumers simultaneously, and the broker would process them as a single unit of work.

In a transactional context, the broker would receive the messages as part of a "batch" when the transaction is committed.
If the messages are part of a transaction and are persistent, and something goes wrong with processing one of the messages
(e.g., the third message fails to be stored), then the entire transaction would be rolled back. This means that the 
broker would need to take appropriate action to undo the effects of the first two messages (like removing from storage
and memory), essentially treating the operation as if it never happened.

This would be the overall behavior programmatically. The idea in the snippet is that we rollback all messages from being
sent if any of them failed:
```
try {
    Session session = connection.createSession(true, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
    Queue queue = session.createQueue("my-queue");
    MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(queue);

    // Create and send three messages
    TextMessage message1 = session.createTextMessage("Message 1");
    TextMessage message2 = session.createTextMessage("Message 2");
    TextMessage message3 = session.createTextMessage("Message 3");

    producer.send(message1);
    producer.send(message2);
    producer.send(message3);

    // Commit the transaction (will send all three messages to the broker)
    session.commit();
} catch (Exception e) {
    session.rollback();
}
```

Transactions in JMS, including ActiveMQ, are localized to the session in which they are created. This means that 
transactions are entirely decoupled between producers and consumers. The three messages sent by the producer within a 
transaction are sent to the broker as part of that transaction, but they would be treated as separate messages once they 
reach the broker.
